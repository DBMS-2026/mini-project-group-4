/*
 * What:
 * BufferPoolManager is the RAM-side caching layer placed above DiskManager.
 *  
 * Why:
 * Right now, if the engine wants the same page many times, it would have to
 * ask DiskManager to read that page from the file again and again. That is
 * correct logically, but wasteful in a DBMS. A buffer pool keeps frequently
 * used pages in memory so repeated access becomes faster.
 *
 * Understanding:
 * - DiskManager knows "how to read/write one page on disk".
 * - BufferPoolManager knows "which disk pages are currently kept in RAM".
 * - If a page is already in RAM, we reuse it.
 * - If a page is not in RAM, we load it from disk into an available frame.
 * - If RAM is full, we evict one old unpinned page using LRU.
 *
 * Concept used:
 * - Fixed-size page frames in memory
 * - Page table: page_id -> frame_id
 * - Pin count: how many users are actively holding a page
 * - Dirty bit: page changed in RAM and must be written back before eviction
 * - LRU policy: least recently used unpinned frame gets replaced first
 *
 * Layman version:
 * - DiskManager is the bookshelf.
 * - BufferPoolManager is the study table.
 * - Frequently needed pages are kept on the table instead of going back to
 *   the bookshelf every single time.
